## Project thoughts

I love sports and sports statistics. Because sports statistics lend themselves to being very comprehensive, I feel like I can find a way to use sports-related statistics for my final project. The sports I am most interested in are basketball, football, and baseball. I just did a deep dive on my own time with ESPN staff writer Bill Connelly's SP+ predictive model for NCAA college football where I scraped and calculated the post-game win expectancy (PGWE) for my favorite team, the Illinois Fighting Illini, and the rest of the Top 25 teams. I would love to work with stats like this somehow, especially if it can relate to my favorite teams like the Illini, the Golden State Warriors, or my favorite players like Stephen Curry and Jayson Tatum.
